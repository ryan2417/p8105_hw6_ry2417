## Problem 1

import data and check for missing value

``` r
children_df <- read_csv("data/birthweight.csv")
children_df %>% 
  skimr::skim() %>% 
  select(skim_variable, n_missing) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| skim\_variable | n\_missing |
|:---------------|-----------:|
| babysex        |          0 |
| bhead          |          0 |
| blength        |          0 |
| bwt            |          0 |
| delwt          |          0 |
| fincome        |          0 |
| frace          |          0 |
| gaweeks        |          0 |
| malform        |          0 |
| menarche       |          0 |
| mheight        |          0 |
| momage         |          0 |
| mrace          |          0 |
| parity         |          0 |
| pnumlbw        |          0 |
| pnumsga        |          0 |
| ppbmi          |          0 |
| ppwt           |          0 |
| smoken         |          0 |
| wtgain         |          0 |

According to the table above, there is no missing value in any variable.
Let’s convert the `babysex`, `frace`, `malform` and `mrace` to factor
variables.

``` r
children_df <- 
  children_df %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = fct_recode(factor(babysex), male = "1", female = "2"),
    frace = fct_recode(factor(frace),
      White = "1", 
      Black = "2", 
      Asian = "3", 
      Puerto_Rican = "4", 
      Other = "8"
    ),
    malform = fct_recode(factor(malform), absent = "0", present = "1"),
    mrace = fct_recode(factor(mrace),
      White = "1", 
      Black = "2", 
      Asian = "3", 
      Puerto_Rican = "4"
    )
  )
```

From my prospective and guess, children birth weight should have
associations with baby’s sex `babysex`, baby’s head circumference at
birth `bhead`, baby’s length at birth `blength`, mother’s age at
menarche `menarche`, gestational age in weeks `gaweeks`, presence of
malformations `malform`, mother’s race `mrace`, mother’s age at delivery
`momage`, mother’s weight gain during pregnancy `wtgain`, average number
of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy `smoken`and mother’s BMI
at delivery, which is the ratio of mother’s weight at delivery `delwt`
to square of mother’s height `mheight`. First of all, I use the scatter
plots between birth weight and each numeric variable to check if the
association is linear.

``` r
children_df <- 
  children_df %>% 
  mutate(
    delbmi = 703*delwt/mheight^2
  ) 
children_df %>% 
  select(bwt, bhead, blength, menarche, gaweeks, momage, wtgain, smoken, delbmi) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -bwt, 
         names_to = "var", values_to = "numeric_variables") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = bwt, x = numeric_variables)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(.~var, scales = "free") +
  labs(y = "birth weight (grams)",
      title = "pair scatterplots (birth weight vs each numeric variable)")
```

Based on these pair scatter plots, we have some ideas about their
associations. The association between birth weight and mother’s BMI at
delivery `delbmi` is piece wise linear with change point at about 28.
The association between birth weight and mother’s age at delivery
`momage` is also is piece wise linear with change point at about 25.
There are no apparent patterns of birth weight with mother’s age at
menarche `menarche` and average number of cigarettes smoked per day
during pregnancy `smoken`. The rest of the plots look linear. Thus, I
will remove `smoken` and `menarche` from my model and use piece-wise
transformation for `momage` and `delbmi`.  

``` r
children_df <- 
  children_df %>% 
  mutate(
    delbmi_cp = (delbmi > 28) * (delbmi - 28),
    momage_cp = (momage > 25) * (momage - 25)
  )
```

For the categorical data, I use the distributions of birth weight among
different levels of each categorical variable to check if it is
necessary to include the variable.

``` r
children_df %>% 
  select(bwt, malform, babysex, mrace) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -bwt, 
         names_to = "var", values_to = "factor_levels") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = bwt, x = factor_levels, factor_levels)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .3) +
  facet_wrap(.~var, scales = "free") +
  labs(y = "birth weight (grams)",
      title = "distribution of birth weight among different levels of categorical varaibles")
```

![](p8105_hw6_ry2417_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

Based on these box plots, there is no significant difference of birth
weight between malformation present and absent, so I would remove
`malform` from the model.  

Then, my model is
`lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + gaweeks + wtgain + momage + momage_cp + delbmi + delbmi_cp + babysex + mrace, data = children_df)`

``` r
my_model <- lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + gaweeks + wtgain + momage + momage_cp + delbmi + delbmi_cp + babysex + mrace, data = children_df)
```

show a plot of model residuals against fitted values

``` r
children_df %>% 
  add_predictions(my_model) %>% 
  add_residuals(my_model) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "scatterplot of residual and prediction of my model",
    x = "predicted birth weight (grams)",
    y = "residual"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw6_ry2417_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

Compare with two other models:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors

``` r
model_2 <- lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = children_df)
```

One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
(including the three-way interaction) between these

``` r
model_3 <- lm(bwt ~ bhead*blength*babysex, data = children_df)
```

Make the comparisons in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;

``` r
set.seed(1200)
cv_df <- crossv_mc(children_df, 500, test = .2) %>% 
  mutate(
    test = map(test, as_tibble)
  )
cv_df <- 
  cv_df %>%
  mutate(
    my_model = map(.x = train, 
                   ~ lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + gaweeks + wtgain + momage + momage_cp + delbmi + delbmi_cp + babysex + mrace,
                        data = .x)),
    model_2 = map(.x = train, ~ lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    model_3 = map(.x = train, ~ lm(bwt ~ bhead*blength*babysex, data = .x))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    rmse_my_model = map2_dbl(.x = my_model, .y = test, ~ rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_2 = map2_dbl(.x = model_2, .y = test, ~ rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_3 = map2_dbl(.x = model_3, .y = test, ~ rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
  )

cv_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("rmse"),
               names_to = "model",
               values_to = "rmse",
               names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_reorder(model, rmse)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse, fill = model)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = .3) +
  labs(y = "rmse",
      title = "distribution of root mean sqaured error of three models")
```

The plot compared the distribution of the prediction error of three
models. Model using length at birth and gestational age as predictors
has the highest prediction error and much higher than the other two
models, implying worse fitting of this model among the three. My model
has the lowest prediction error among the three models. It fits a bit
better than the one using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions.
